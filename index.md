### Sold $UPST Mar 28 2024 26 Put

$UPST has dropped significantly since earnings. Their earnings showed a long, but tenable road back to profitability once rate cuts come in in the latter
half of the year. Therefore, I didn't mind owning at the previous, pre-earnings prices and I really don't mind owning now. Plus, if I get assigned, this will help average down my position. The ~100% volatility on this stock makes it a tempting target to sell puts on as well, so either way, I'm happy with the outcome
