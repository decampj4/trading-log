### Sold $UPST Mar 28 2024 26 Put

$UPST has dropped significantly since earnings. Their earnings showed a long, but tenable road back to profitability once rate cuts come in in the latter
half of the year. Therefore, I didn't mind owning at the previous, pre-earnings prices and I really don't mind owning now. Plus, if I get assigned, this will help average down my position. The ~100% volatility on this stock makes it a tempting target to sell puts on as well, so either way, I'm happy with the outcome

### Sold $UPST Apr 5 2024 26 Put

A previous sold put that I had open on $UPST at the $25 strike hit my ~50% profit target and closed this morning. This is an opportunity to continue to sell volatility and get long theta on $UPST and the logic from my previous put sale on 2024-02-27 still holds. I still anticipate getting assigned on a put sold at a strike of $32.50, so continuing to have exposure to either get assigned more shares at a lower strike or reduce the loss on the overall position via theta decay is advantageous. Further, if I get assigned on this position and assuming that I've been assigned the shares from the $32.50 put, it gives me the opportunity to start selling a call against 100 shares and let the remaining 100 be exposed to my expected upside as rates drop in the latter half of the year

### Sold $UPST Apr 26 2024 23 Put

More or less the same logic as the previous trades on $UPST. PPI came in hot, which caused inflation expectations to change and the number of potential FED rate cuts to decrease, which pushed down small caps, particularly $UPST with its balance sheet full of loans that it would otherwise seek to sell. Until FED rates come down, $UPST is suceptible to this risk. All the more reason as well to sell a 43 DTE option rather than ~30 DTE to give myself time and padding with the amount of premium collected. Again, another opportunity to average down. This is now my maximum exposure that I'm willing to have to $UPST.

### Day trade of $XSP Mar 20 2024 518 Put

I bought this put as a hedge against the Fed meeting. On a $XSP beta weighted basis, it made my portfolio approximately delta neutral. The theta and volatility decay of such an option is high, but worth it considering the potential for downside here. Moreover, I bought the put about an hour before the release of the decision to try to minimize the both potential drift away from my strike before the meeting and the amount of theta decay (certainly a significant tradeoff with other factors, but after all, this is insurance and insurance is expensive). As soon as the Fed statement came out and it became clear that 3 rate cuts were still possible this year, I sold this put. Overall, I bought at $1.82 and sold at $1.02, so not a bad price to pay for some insurance.

### Bought to close $UPST Apr 26 2024 23 Put

This put got near my price target, so I bought it back so that I could reposition more aggressively with more theta decay and closer to the money

### Bought to close $UPST Mar 28 2024 26 Put

This put hit my price target and closed automatically

### Sold $UPST Apr 19 2024 26 Put and Apr 26 2024 27 Put

With the market viewing rate cuts later in the year as more likely and two of my existing puts closing, this strengths the $UPST bull case and encourages the idea of maintaining maximum exposure to this position. Selling these puts gives me good theta and delta exposure as $UPST, hopefully, continues to climb. If not, I still get to average down my cost basis

### Sold $UPST Apr 12 2024 28 Put

This trade is a continuation of my bullish and aggressive put selling on $UPST and was executed after an existing Apr 5 $26 put hit my profit target and was automatically repurchased. I was the most aggressive that I've been yet with my put selling, slightly in the money and 22 days out. It still gives me some cushion if $UPST reverses this trend and this strike is still significantly under my cost basis of the shares assigned at $32.50. It is pertinent to point out that $UPST biggest risk at this point is significant renewed inflation expectations. AS much as the FED seemed to confirm 3 rate cuts into the end of the year, there is still a case to be made the inflation, especially super core inflation, picks back up. As this position plays out over the next couple weeks, I'm going to bear that in mind when it comes to any potential opportunities to reposition or potentially derisk in general. I remain at my maximum allocation to this position and if we start to approach my current cost basis of $32.50, I intend to walk back my exposure to ~50% allocation.

### Bought to close $UPST Apr 19 2024 26 Put and bought 100 shares of $UPST

I've been trying to average down the cost basis of the shares that I was assigned and it seemed logical to close the put for a 20% profit and then just outright buy the shares. This trade (I'm treating this as one trade since I'm closing the put to free up capital to buy the shares) not only increases my delta exposure to this position, but also incementally increases my capital allocation. Moreover, it decreases my theta on the position. So overall, it allows this position to have a higher delta while the prices still seems to be relatively depressed. It also therefore increases my risk. We shall see how this plays out, but if the stock price rises to between $32.5 and $40, then I will look to sell covered calls on this position.

#### Trade plan

Hold these shares as the part of core long position and sell covered calls as the opportunity presents itself

### Rolled $UPST Apr 12 2024 28 Put to May 3 2024 27 Put and rolled $UPST Apr 26 2024 27 Put to May 10 2024 26 Put

Two things happened last week that seem to increase the possibility that the fed will remain higher for longer: 1. A strong jobs report 2. Fed speakers said so. While these are relatively simplistic reasons, the market seemed to take them seriously, at least to some extent. The consequence of the rate lower probability repricing means that $UPST's value suffered accordingly. Therefore, it seemed to make sense to be able to roll out these puts. It decreases my positive delta exposure, but I could roll for a small credit and increase my positive theta. With this roll, I get paid to make my position a little more defensive.

#### Trade plan

Hold these puts until expiration and get assigned or buy it back for the same target price that I had for the previous puts before I rolled ($1.00)

### Sold $PLTR May 3 2024 23 Put

I've been looking for a way to get long $PLTR for a bit now. Some of the euphoria from earnings seems to have faded and it getting some long delta and theta on another more volatile stock like $PLTR helps my overall portfolio. The strike is before earnings, which moderately reduces my risk. Overall, this doesn't seem like the worst potential entry if I get assigned

#### Trade plan

Hold this put until expiration and get assigned or buy it back for about 60-70% of max profit

## 2024-04-10

### Sold $PLTR May 3 2024 22.5 Put

A drop in the overall market as a reaction to inflation data gives me the chance to allocate a little more to $PLTR before earnings. Same logic as above, just want to get exposure now that the runup euphoria has faded and collect some premium before earnings

#### Trade plan

Hold these this until expiration and get assigned or buy it back for about 60-70% of max profit

### Sold $UPST May 10 2024 30 Call

Hold this until expiration

### Closed $PLTR May 10 2024 23 Put and May 3 2024 22.5 Put

### Sold $PLTR May 24 2024 21.5 Put

After the post earnings drop, this seems like another good potential long entry point

### Bought to close $UPST May 10 2024 26 Put

This put was bought back automatically when it hit my price target

### Sold to open $UPST May 31 2024 26 Put and May 31 2024 29 Call

I wanted to maintain sold put exposure and capitalize on the run up in $UPST, so I effectively sold a 22 DTE strangle

#### Trade plan

Close the put at ~60% profit and close the call for $0.10 or let the shares get called away at expiration

### Bought to close $UPST May 31 2024 26 Put

This put was bought back automatically when it hit my price target

### Rolled $UPST May 31 2024 29 Call to June 14 2024 30 Call

I rolled this up and out for a credit in order to take advantage of $UPST run up (seemingly a sympathy move with $GME)

#### Trade plan

Close for $0.10 or let the shares get called away at expiration

### Sold to open $UPST May 24 2024 27 Put and May 24 2024 32 Call

Again, I wanted to maintain sold put exposure and capitalize on the continued run up in $UPST, so I effectively sold a 10 DTE strangle

## 2024-05-17

### Rolled $PLTR May 24 2024 21.5 Put to June 7 2024 21.5 Put

The put hit my price target, so I rolled it out by 14 days to pick up more theta

![PLTR Chart](/trading-log/docs/assets/2024-05-17-pltr.png)

### Sold $UPST 23/30 June 14 2024 Strangle

I want to continue to get long theta exposure and short volatility on $UPST. Moreover, I have enough upside exposure in this position, so the relatively delta neutral strangle made sense here. In the best/worst case scenarios, some of my shares get called away or I reduce my cost basis significantly.

#### Trade plan

Close each leg when it hits ~60% profit

![UPST Chart](/trading-log/docs/assets/2024-05-17-upst.png)

## 2024-05-21

### Rolled $UPST 23/30 June 14 2024 Strangle to 23/28.5 June 21 2024 Strangle

I made money on the call leg and broke even on the put leg, so it seemed logical to roll this out time wise and move the call lower to pick up more premium and a little more delta sensitivity in the call side, which makes this a bit of a downside hedge.

#### Trade plan

Close each leg when it hits ~60% profit

### Bought to close $UPST June 14 2024 30 Call

With $UPST down today, it felt like a good opportunity to close this position for a signifant profit (not quite my price target, but close enough to take the win, especially with 24 DTE left on the option). As this week shakes out, I want to look at re-selling a call on $UPST to continue to hedge my considerable long position here.
