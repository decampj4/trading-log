### Sold $UPST Mar 28 2024 26 Put

$UPST has dropped significantly since earnings. Their earnings showed a long, but tenable road back to profitability once rate cuts come in in the latter
half of the year. Therefore, I didn't mind owning at the previous, pre-earnings prices and I really don't mind owning now. Plus, if I get assigned, this will help average down my position. The ~100% volatility on this stock makes it a tempting target to sell puts on as well, so either way, I'm happy with the outcome

### Sold $UPST Apr 5 2024 26 Put

A previous sold put that I had open on $UPST at the $25 strike hit my ~50% profit target and closed this morning. This is an opportunity to continue to sell volatility and get long theta on $UPST and the logic from my previous put sale on 2024-02-27 still holds. I still anticipate getting assigned on a put sold at a strike of $32.50, so continuing to have exposure to either get assigned more shares at a lower strike or reduce the loss on the overall position via theta decay is advantageous. Further, if I get assigned on this position and assuming that I've been assigned the shares from the $32.50 put, it gives me the opportunity to start selling a call against 100 shares and let the remaining 100 be exposed to my expected upside as rates drop in the latter half of the year

### Sold $UPST Apr 26 2024 23 Put

More or less the same logic as the previous trades on $UPST. PPI came in hot, which caused inflation expectations to change and the number of potential FED rate cuts to decrease, which pushed down small caps, particularly $UPST with its balance sheet full of loans that it would otherwise seek to sell. Until FED rates come down, $UPST is suceptible to this risk. All the more reason as well to sell a 43 DTE option rather than ~30 DTE to give myself time and padding with the amount of premium collected. Again, another opportunity to average down. This is now my maximum exposure that I'm willing to have to $UPST.
